                    <p>Grocery shopping, banking, buying shoes, dating — people will do almost anything online these
                        days. But there isn’t an app that can cut your hair (yet), so the salon industry is still
                        largely an offline world.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        When it comes to personal grooming — and stocking up on your favourite hair products — most of
                        us rely on brick and mortar shops. And maybe because of this, consumers don’t enjoy the same
                        selection and availability in hair care products that they might for other goods. Rob Gaspar set
                        out to solve this problem. He’s bringing the individualized service and special attention you
                        get in a salon chair to his new online shop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the age of 15, Rob has worked in salons. “I started out shampooing hair and mopping
                        floors, but I was determined about where I wanted to be. I didn’t just want to be a great
                        hairdresser, I wanted to own my own shop,” he explains.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rob has been mastering every aspect of the hair industry for the past 25 years. After opening
                        his own salon, Mast Hair in 2018, he set his sights on a new opportunity. “I would work on
                        clients for ten hours a day, but I knew there was more to it than just being behind the chair. I
                        started seeing weaknesses in men’s hair care lines, and that got me thinking,” he says.
                    </p>

                <h2>
                    "I would work on clients for ten hours a day, but I knew there was more to it than just being
                    behind
                    the chair. I started seeing weaknesses in men’s hair care lines, and that got me thinking."
                </h2>
                <div class="cs-text">
                    <p>
                        For Rob, there was a gap in the market. “The product that’s out there is either really expensive
                        or really cheap. You have barber shop brands or cheap brands that cater to drug stores. I knew
                        from working with my clients that men just wanted something that was clean and high-quality,
                        with branding that connected to them,” he says. “I knew that if I could develop a product I
                        liked, there would be a market for it.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The process for developing and marketing haircare products hasn’t changed much over the years.
                        Traditionally, you create something, put it in a bottle and push it to distributors. Rob set out
                        to change that. He created his own line and brought it directly to his customers through his
                        salon and website. “I wanted something that got rid of the fluff. Something catering to guys who
                        are busy, travelling and on the go—but who are spending $50 on a haircut and want something nice
                        for themselves,” he explains. “I took all the best aspects of men’s lines I’ve worked with, and
                        created my own.”
                    </p>

                <div class="cs-text">
                    <p>
                        But Rob didn’t just develop a line of products and call it a day. He’s changing the way people
                        shop for their salon products. “The world is moving faster and faster, and we are in the age of
                        digital everything. It has to be available at the touch of a button, because there is always
                        someone else willing to take your place,” he says. “The way we “prescribe” our products is
                        unique—based on information about how each client uses them, so every recommendation is
                        individualized. Having that attention to detail is important because today’s consumer demands

                        For Rob, the challenge was changing the way people get their hands on Mast’s products. “Men tend
                        to buy their products in the shop because their hairdresser is telling them to buy it, and then
                        they don’t get more until the next time they’re in. If they run out before their next haircut,
                        they end up using their wives’ or moms’ product,” he laughs. So Rob not only stocks his Mast
                        products in his shop, but he also offers a unique subscription service through his website.
                        “Because my clients are busy and on the go, I wanted a system where we could figure out how much
                        product they use and then send it right to their door before they run out,” he says.

                    <p>
                        Pam Draper spent 14 years in the traditional banking industry before taking a leap into the
                        ever-evolving and mysterious world of cryptocurrency. As Bitvo’s President and CEO, Pam gets a
                        lot of questions, like: “What is cryptocurrency?” “Is bitcoin actually for real?” “Did you
                        really leave banking to start this?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cryptocurrency has no central entity or government regulator. While it has proven to be an
                        effective way for early adopters to generate wealth, there’s a major barrier to would-be
                        investors: it’s nearly impossible to spend cryptocurrency offline in the real world. And without
                        regulators—there are some reasonable fears about sending your money into the ether. Enter Pam
                        Draper and the Bitvo team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With a vision to bring security and legitimacy and a human face to the crypto world—Pam is
                        working to remove barriers so more people can get into buying and trading bitcoin, ether and the
                        multitude of other coins out there. “If you go onto a lot of other cryptocurrency exchanges it’s
                        hard to see who the backer and management team actually is. On our exchange, you’ll see quite
                        prominently who we are, what our backgrounds are, our bios and our pictures. It makes it a lot
                        more real than a potential robot in the background that you’re giving your money to.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Versett helped Pam and the Bitvo team launch their cryptocurrency exchange in under six months.
                        We worked together to develop the visual language, name, brand and design philosophy while our
                        engineering team designed, built and deployed a customer-focused exchange for the web and iOS.

                <div class="cs-text">
                    <p>What’s remarkable about Bitvo? They’ve set out to offer a direct-to-consumer cash card that makes
                        it easy to get your money out of the cryptocurrency exchange and use it in real life. Pam has
                        been leading Bitvo towards the launch of their online exchange and physical cash card. What
                        they’re up to doesn’t have a tried and true playbook. “It’s brand new and nothing like it has
                        ever existed before, so we’re really starting from scratch.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On top of the challenge of a new business in a new industry, Bitvo has some big goals. “We’re
                        aiming to remove the friction typically associated with buying cryptocurrencies,” Pam explains
                        “We do that in three areas—number one is signing up for your account, number two is transferring
                        funds between your bank and the exchange, and number three is the ability to access customer
                        support.” To make all of this happen, Bitvo launched with a same-day guarantee, which provides
                        instant account registration and same-day processing of deposits and withdrawals—all while
                        providing live customer support 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This immediacy is part of Bitvo’s vision to solve some of the common pain points users
                        experience in cryptocurrency exchanges. “The key challenge that exchanges have faced is really
                        the timing to move funds off of the exchange into flat currency. There are significant delays in
                        terms of getting your money from your crypto account into your traditional bank account—this can
                        be anywhere from three weeks to an undefined amount of time,” Pam explains.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On top of solving the account transfer roadblock, Pam’s team is also finding ways to make the
                        verification process smoother and more user-friendly. Up to this point, the process has been
                        clunky and manual. “It entails things like taking a selfie and a photo of your ID,” Pam
                        explains.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bitvo has automated account registration and funding and withdrawal transactions to make the
                        process quick, but also less prone to human error. They’re also looking to the future, and
                        making trading on Bitvo more compliant with potential regulations that aren't in place yet—but
                        eventually will be.

                    <p>In the process of bringing Bitvo to the world, customer service was paramount. To deliver a

                        do—was most important. But we also wanted live customer support so you can chat with a real
                        person on the phone, or on an online chat portal, or with someone over email. If you run into a
                        problem, someone who understands the platform and cryptocurrency is available at your fingertips

                    <p>As it stands, online service for banking customers has lagged behind other retailers. Large
                        banks—like RBC or TD—typically act as end-to-end organizations that offer the full gamut of
                        banking services, from business banking, to personal banking, to wealth management and
                        insurance. But if you look at the websites of most large, multi-service banks today, it’s not
                        possible for a customer to sign up for all the different products in the bank’s suite in one go.
                        Shashank Tripathi and his team at Zafin are working to change that.
                    </p>
                    <p>Shashank leads the product vision for Zafin. He built his career in the banking world, so he has
                        a deep understanding of what banks struggle with—and what their customers are looking for.
                        Shashank has leveraged his unique vantage point to develop a platform at an accelerated
                        speed—and within a budget that makes innovating on a large scale much more palatable to banks
                        with millions of customers.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Traditionally, innovation is heavily focused on core banking technologies—but not necessarily
                        things that make life easier for users,” Shashank explains. “We recognized an opportunity for
                        signing up users, which is something we call Digital Onboarding.”
                    </p>

                <div class="cs-text">
                    <p>Typically, a bank’s end user would have to individually (and arduously) sign up for 12 separate
                        products separately. That would mean filling out 12 forms—with essentially the same information
                        every single time. Zafin recognized that streamlining this process was a big opportunity to
                        improve the experience for customers.
                    </p>
                    <p>He compares Zafin’s vision for their platform to an experience like Amazon’s ecommerce website.
                        Just as you would add multiple products to your cart and checkout in one transaction, with
                        Zafin, you can sign up for a chequing account, TFSA and RRSP account and a line of credit—and do
                        it all at once. </p>
                    <p>The Zafin team has put a lot of fanatical attention on user experience design, which has not
                        traditionally been the strong suit of the financial sector. And if banks were to create this
                        functionality completely in-house, they would typically partner with a large consulting firm.
                        “Their ITP’s would be involved, it would be a big mothership of a project for three-to-five
                        years. It would take multi-billion dollars and a lot of program management. That whole shebang
                        would happen and at then end, the project is over budget and there is a lot of slippage on the
                        delivery time,” says Shashank.</p>

                        product. Banks can white label this software so the end user sees their branding, language and
                        unique experience. “We make sure that they have customizations—like the kind of documents needed
                        for their onboarding journey. Bank by bank, there are policy departments that have slightly
                        different stipulations on those requirements. As long as we cater to those customizations, in
                        three-to-six months they can have a presence in the market—having spent a fraction of what it
                        would have cost to develop it in-house,” he explains.</p>
                    <p>
                        We asked Shashank if he had any advice for other entrepreneurs who are designing a platform that
                        they want to scale. He told us, “be nimble in what you bring to market first, and then continue
                        to enhance progressively. A lot of start-ups struggle with what their Minimum Viable Product
                        should look like. Especially in businesses that are B2B, because it’s hard to say no to a
                        client,” he explains. For Shashank, it’s more important to get a product out to market early for
                        a client than to make sure it’s the absolutely idealized version. You can always rapidly and
                        progressively enhance a product after release.
                    </p>
                    <p>While Zafin is currently laser-focused on client number one, their larger goal is to rapidly
                        improve upon the platform so other clients in North America can integrate it as well. Zafin is
                        in a trailblazing space, with a mission to continue improving on functionality every step of the
                        way. Soon, you may just be saving a lot of time signing up for new services and accounts. And
                        that's a bonus you can take to the bank.
